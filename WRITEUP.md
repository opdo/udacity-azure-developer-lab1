# Dear reviewer,

### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

For VM:

- Analyze costs: start with B1ls is about $3.7960/month, we could choose 1 year savings or 3 year savings to more cheaper
- Scalability, availability: high availability and scaling (benefits of VM)
- Workflow: configuration everything

For App Service:

- Analyze costs: cost based on app service plan, Minimum is Free Tier
- Scalability, availability: high availability and scaling (the same with VM), vertical and horizontal scaling
- Workflow: easy deploy and config

I decided to choose App Service because of:

- I just want to deploy a small application
- I want to deploy quicky, dont want to take much time to config and manage server

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

If in the feature the number of user increase or the need of dedicated server for security reasons so i would change my decision.
